// .reduce is when you have a collections of elements and reducing it down to a single value.
// .map alters all the elements in an array form. .map is used for arrays
//.filter chooses certain elements in the array and give that in an array.
// you can use .map .filter, .reduce on collections of elements (arrays, dictionary, sets, Strings)

// trailing syntex means you are not going to use a function but instead fall back on $0,$1
// example using $0 and $1
